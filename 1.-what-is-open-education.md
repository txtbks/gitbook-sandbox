# 1. What is Open Education?

Education is essential to advancing society. It’s how we pass down the wealth of human knowledge and equip the next generation of leaders, innovators and productive members of society. Our educational systems are built with the goal of providing every person the opportunity to build a better life—by turning children into citizens, learners into teachers, laborers into skilled workers.

Expanding educational opportunities is more possible now than it has ever been before. Through the Internet, learners can find information instantly on virtually any topic, teachers can share their knowledge with students on another continent almost as easily as in their own classroom, and educational materials can be disseminated to a worldwide audience at virtually no marginal cost.  


## Open Education Defined

{% hint style="info" %}
**Open Education encompasses educational resources, tools and practices that can be freely and fully used in the digital environment without legal, financial or technical barriers. The meaning of “open” is typically defined in terms of users being able to freely exercise the five “R” rights: retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute \(Wiley, 2014\)**

Open Education is the realization of everything education can be in today’s world: where teachers, learners and members of society can leverage all of the new pathways offered by technology to create and share knowledge together. This can start as small as a student using open resources to enrich her education, or become as large as an entire university that offers courses openly online to the entire world.
