# 3. Why Open Education?

### Open education realizes the possibilities of the digital age

When using traditional educational materials, educators can identify problems and alert the author or publisher to them, but they must then wait for the next edition before seeing a correction. With OER, any shortcomings in the materials can be corrected immediately, because open resources give educators permission to make changes. The adaptability of OER offer the ability to provide targeted, localized education experiences to students from different locations, cultures, and backgrounds. \(Wiley, 2014\).  


### Open education gives educators and learners control over content

Iiyoshi and Kumar \(2008\) make the case that the networked, information age provides endless opportunity for taking learning outside the formal model where teachers \(who possess all the requisite knowledge\) impart a set of facts and students receive it. They argue the most meaningful education experiences never worked that way in the first place. Because education, at its core, is about sharing and creating knowledge in community, the digital age provides an unprecedented opportunity for educational communities of all types, whether formal or informal, to self-organize and create knowledge together, bypassing the closed, costly, traditional education industry.  


### Using OER can enable educators to become more involved and invested in teaching and learning practice.

**“Most open licenses permit instructors to create customized versions of the textbook for use in their own classroom.  For example, an instructor could remove unwanted chapters, change notations, or insert their own sections and examples. Instructors can distribute their customized versions online, or have them printed for students by the bookstore or a local copy shop.” \(Fasimpaur, 2015\)**
